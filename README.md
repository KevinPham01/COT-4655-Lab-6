# Lab 6 FireChat
## Overview
FireChat is a real-time chat application developed with SwiftUI and Firebase Firestore. This app allows users to participate in live conversations, with messages instantly synchronized across devices. Transitioning from using Parse to Firebase, FireChat showcases the strengths of Firebaseâ€™s real-time database features, enabling seamless user communication in an interactive chat environment.

## Features

* Real-time Messaging: Users can send messages, which are instantly visible on all connected devices.
* Dynamic Message Display: Messages are styled differently based on the sender, with unique positions and colors indicating ownership (i.e., user vs. other participants).
* Firebase Integration: Firestore serves as the app's backend, handling data storage, retrieval, and synchronization across devices in real-time.
*  Authentication: User login and registration with Firebase Authentication.
* Enhanced Messaging Options: Additional message types like images, emojis, or custom reactions.
* Chat Customization: Customizable themes or styles for different users.

## What I Learned

* Firebase Firestore Integration: Setting up Firebase Firestore as a backend and configuring it to handle real-time data sync for chat functionality.
* Observable Objects and Environment: Using observable objects to manage state and user data, and passing them within the environment for smoother data flow across views.
* Real-time Data Handling: Implementing listeners in Firestore to receive live data updates, making the chat experience responsive and dynamic.
* UI Customization in SwiftUI: Creating a chat UI with distinct styling for user and participant messages, enhancing readability and user experience.
